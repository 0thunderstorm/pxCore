=========

Initial steps of creating an 'rtNode' module that will -

  * Own cration of 'node' context and isolate data
  * More correctly create rtObject/Scene and add/create objects into this context/isolate
  * Skeleton class/interface provided in 'rtNode.h'

Intention is to begin to depricate "load.js" and JS invoked scene creation.  
Prefer C++ ownership and/or threading.

Aim to make 'node' more "embeddable" 

TODO:

- Fix 'node' initialization - similar to node::Start()

- Refine scope of a given 'node" context
- Implement add/remove rtObject to JS execution context
- Implement threading options for JS execution context
- Provide parental/child scope with optional "kill" child.
